# cl-asteroids
Common Lisp Asteroids Clone

## Installation and loading

```bat
mklink /J c:\home\quicklisp\local-projects\cl-asteroids c:\home\projects\cl-asteroids
```

## What is this?
* the idea in this repo was to create a simple asteroids game clone (based on an example from the tic-80 fantasy computer community)
* this was based on my own [cl-game-spell](https://github.com/drigoor/cl-game-spell)
* it is using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) for drawing and input
